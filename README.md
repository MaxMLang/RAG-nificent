RAG-nificent is a state-of-the-art repository that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide instant answers and references from a curated directory of PDFs containing information on any given topic such as WHO recommendations documents. This system is designed to aid researchers, policy makers, and the public in quickly finding specific information within extensive documents.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Engage with the system using natural language queries to receive responses directly sourced from the PDFs.
- **Direct Citation**: Every response from the system includes a direct link to the source PDF page, ensuring traceability and verification.
- **PDF Directory**: A predefined set of key PDF documents, currently including WHO recommendations on major health topics such as schistosomiasis and malaria.

## Available Models

- ðŸ¦™ **llama-3.1-8b-instant**: Experience instant, efficient responses with this model optimized for quick interactions.
- ðŸ¦™ **llama-3.1-70b-versatile**: Utilize this versatile model for a wide range of complex language tasks with high accuracy.
- ðŸ“˜ **gpt-3.5-turbo**: Engage with advanced, human-like interactions suitable for varied conversational tasks.
- ðŸ¦™ **llama3-70b-8192**: Enjoy high-end performance with this large-scale model, ideal for deep learning insights.
- ðŸ¦™ **llama3-8b-8192**: Harness robust capabilities with this more accessible version of Llama3, perfect for a wide range of AI applications.
- ðŸŒŸ **mixtral-8x7b-32768**: Leverage the power of ensemble modeling with Mixtral's extensive capacity for nuanced understanding and response generation.
- ðŸ’Ž **gemma-7b-it**: Explore specialized interactions and tech-focused solutions with Gemma, tailored for IT and technical content.

## How It Works

The application utilizes a combination of OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone vector search, and a conversational interface to provide a seamless retrieval experience. When a query is made, the system:

1. Converts the query into embeddings.
2. Searches for the most relevant document sections using Pinecone's vector search.
3. Returns the answer along with citations and links to the source documents.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-nificent.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set environment variables in a `.env` (also see `.env.example`file:
   - `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`
   - `PINECONE_NAME_SPACE`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `PINECONE_API_KEY`
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`

4. Create a [Pinecone](pinecone.io) index with the same name as  `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`. Set it up with `dimensions=1536` and `metric=cosine`.
5. Place your PDFs in the `pdf_data` directory and run `data_ingestion.py`
6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run src/app.py
   ```

## Source Documents

The system currently includes guidelines from the following PDFs with direct links to the documents:

- [WHO guideline on control and elimination of human schistosomiasis (2022)](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/351856/9789240041608-eng.pdf)
- [WHO guidelines for malaria (2023)](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373339/WHO-UCN-GMP-2023.01-Rev.1-eng.pdf)
